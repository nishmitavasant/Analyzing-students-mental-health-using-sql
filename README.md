# International Students' Mental Health Analysis

![Mental Health](https://github.com/nishmitavasant/Analyzing-students-mental-health-using-sql/blob/main/mentalhealth.jpg)

## Overview

This project explores the mental health of international students using survey data from a Japanese university. The analysis focuses on the impact of social connectedness and acculturative stress on depression, with additional insights on how the length of stay influences these factors.

## Project Structure

- **Data**: The dataset used for this analysis is available [here](https://github.com/nishmitavasant/Analyzing-students-mental-health-using-sql/blob/main/students.csv).
- **Code**: The Jupyter notebook containing the SQL analysis is available [here](https://github.com/nishmitavasant/Analyzing-students-mental-health-using-sql/blob/main/notebook.ipynb).

## Analysis Highlights

- **Utilized SQL on PostgreSQL**:
  - Performed data extraction, transformation, and analysis.
  - Employed complex joins, aggregations, and subqueries to investigate mental health indicators.
  - Used advanced SQL techniques such as window functions and CTEs (Common Table Expressions).

- **Key Findings**:
  - Higher levels of depression in international students are observed in the initial years of their stay.
  - Prolonged acculturative stress persists even after several years.
  - Social connectedness fluctuates but does not show a clear trend over time.

## Conclusion

The analysis supports the hypothesis that international students face significant mental health challenges, particularly in the early years of their stay. These findings highlight the need for targeted mental health interventions and support systems to improve the well-being of international students.
